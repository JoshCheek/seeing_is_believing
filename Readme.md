Seeing Is Believing
===================

Evaluates a file, recording the results of each line of code.
You can then use this to display output values like Bret Victor does with JavaScript in his talk [Inventing on Principle][inventing_on_principle].
Except, obviously, his is like a million times better.

Also comes with a binary to show how it might be used.

For whatever reason, I can't embed videos, but **here's a ~1 minute [video][video]** showing it off.


Use The Binary
==============

```ruby
# $ seeing_is_believing proving_grounds/basic_functionality.rb
5.times do |i|
  i * 2         # => 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
end             # => 5

def meth(n)
  n             # => "12", "34"
end             # => nil

# some invocations
meth "12"       # => "12"
meth "34"       # => "34"
```

```ruby
# $ bin/seeing_is_believing proving_grounds/raises_exception.rb 2>/dev/null
1 + 1          # => 2
raise "ZOMG!"  # ~> RuntimeError: ZOMG!
1 + 1
```

```bash
# $ bin/seeing_is_believing proving_grounds/raises_exception.rb 1>/dev/null
ZOMG!
```

Use The Lib
===========

```ruby
require 'seeing_is_believing'

believer = SeeingIsBelieving.new("%w[a b c].each do |i|
                                    i.upcase
                                  end")

result = believer.call
result      # => #<SeeingIsBelieving::Result:0x007faeed1a5b78 @max_line_number=3, @min_line_number=1, @results={2=>['"A"', '"B"', '"C"'], 3=>['["a", "b", "c"]']}>

result.to_a # => [ [1, []],
            #      [2, ['"A"', '"B"', '"C"']],
            #      [3, ['["a", "b", "c"]']]
            #    ]

result[2]   # => ['"A"', '"B"', '"C"']
```

Install
=======


    $ gem install seeing_is_believing

Or if you haven't fixed your gem home, and you aren't using any version managers:

    $ sudo gem install seeing_is_believing

Rubygems is allowing pushes again, but if it goes back down, you can install like this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing/
    $ cd seeing_is_believing
    $ gem build seeing_is_believing.gemspec
    $ gem install seeing_is_believing-0.0.8.gem
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf "./seeing_is_believing"

TextMate Integration
====================

Go to the bundle editor, create this new command in the Ruby bundle:

    "${TM_RUBY}" -r seeing_is_believing/binary -e '
      SeeingIsBelieving::Binary.new(ARGV, $stdin, $stdout, $stderr).call
    '  $TM_FILEPATH 2>/dev/null

It should look like this:

![textmate-integration][textmate-integration]

Emacs Integration
=================

Add this function to your Emacs configuration:

~~~~ scheme
(defun seeing-is-believing ()
  "Replace the current region (or the whole buffer, if none) with the output
of seeing_is_believing."
  (interactive)
  (let ((beg (if (region-active-p) (region-beginning) (point-min)))
        (end (if (region-active-p) (region-end) (point-max))))
    (shell-command-on-region beg end "seeing_is_believing" nil 'replace)))
~~~~

You can now call `seeing-is-believing` to replace the current region
or current buffer contents with the output of running it through
`seeing_is_believing`.

Known Issues
============

* `BEGIN/END` breaks things and I probably won't take the time to fix it, becuase it's nontrivial and its really meant for command-line scripts, but there is currently a cuke for it
* Heredocs aren't recorded. It might actually be possible if the ExpressionList were to get smarter
* Return statements are dealt with poorly, causing some situations where you could capture and display a value to not capture
