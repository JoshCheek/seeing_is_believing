Seeing Is Believing
===================

Evaluates Ruby code, recording the results of each line.
Integrates with any extensible editor (I've integrated it with many already, see [the list](https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing/wiki/Editor-Integration)).
If you like Swift Playgrounds, you'll like SiB.
